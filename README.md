## Instructions
### 1) Search for static website themes.
Having learnt basics of Markdown and having created a Github account,  you can now begin by searching for static website themes supported by Github pages and Jekyll over the internet.

A couple of good themes have been linked under [more resources.](#more-resources)

> Etter describes in his book that static websites are easy to setup, secure and are fast. They do not have server side dependencies and therefore they are not generated dynamically.

### 2) Fork the repository.
> According to Github docs by forking a repository a copy of it is created in your profile, from which changes can be made without affecting the original repository.

Once the theme has been selected, go to its github repository;

  1.  On the repository, click the `Fork` button found on top-right part of the screen.  
  2.  This would prompt you to enter a repository name.
      - It is very important to note that the repository name should be written as `username.github.io`
      - Leave the default setting as is, and finally
      - click on `create fork` button.

### 3) Modifying the resume template.
- Now that we already have the theme/template copied on our repository, we can go ahead and edit the `_config.yml`. 
- By editing the `_config.yml` file we will be able to modify and add content of your own resume to show on the static website.
  1. To edit the file, click on the file, then click on the pencil icon at the top.
   
  2. Add your content to the file, write a commit message such as "updated _config.yml" or "added resume content" and press the `Commit changes` button.

> This ensures the website content is updated instantly. In his book, Andrew Etter advices to host content on website for the very same reason and also adds that in this way content is kept in sync to new updates.

### 4) Viewing the website.
ðŸŽ‰Congratulations!ðŸŽŠ You have successfully hosted a resume on Github Pages.  

You should now be able to view your static website at `https://username.github.io/`

Here after, any updates added to the `_config.yml` file will automatically be synced with the website and will be ready to be viewed on a browser as soon as github pages reloads the website in the background.

- Markdown has some of the helpful benefits such as Simplicity, Portability, Speed, Version control, Accessibility 
- 

#### Why is my resume not showing up?
1. Ensure your Github repository name is `username.github.io`. This can be changed from **Repository Settings > General > Repository name**
2. Ensure your Github repository is `public`. This can be changed from **Repository Settings > General > Danger Zone > Change respository visibility**
3. Ensure your Github pages is built from `master` branch. This can be changed from **Repository Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Branch**




- As simple as that, the website can now be viewed locally on `http://localhost:4000` or on `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`
